            <h2>Shooting on film</h2>
            <p id="film-body">Compared to digital photography, I find that the process of shooting on film feels much more intimate. It's a very in-the-moment activity – I won't know how it turned out until later, so it saves me from the cycle of recomposing and reshooting that I otherwise often find myself in. Even if the picture doesn't turn out how I'd hoped, the imperfections capture something special about the moment. They're snapshots of a moment in time, in the way that digital photos never quite could be for me.</p>

    <!-- <p>I used to shoot quite a lot on a digital camera when I was younger. I loved composing shots, and playing with the exposure settings to try and capture what I found special about it. Eventually, though not consciously, I think I grew tired of the amount of time I would put into each shot. I would sit there, tweaking settings and reshooting, trying to get a 'perfect' shot. Eventually, I stopped shooting altogether. It wasn't until university that I took it up again, but this time on film.</p>

    <p>Film called to me, as it emphasised the part I loved about shooting, and eliminated that which I hated. The choices that go into composing a shot are amplified on film, and the process of shooting feels much more intimate. And afterwards, there's no need to recompose and retake, trying in vain to get that 'perfect' shot. It's a very in-the-moment activity – you won't know how it turned out until later. And, even if the picture doesn't turn out how you hoped, the imperfections capture something special about the moment. It's a snapshot of a moment in time, in the way that digital photos never quite could be for me.</p>

    <p>I also picked up a cute little half-frame point-and-shoot Kodak, for when I wanted to get pictures on film, but without the responsibility of a proper camera. This is my camera for parties, or day trips with friends. In retrospect, my choice to first load it with a roll of 36-exposure was a mistake. 72 exposures is a lot to fill up, especially with how unintentionally selective I was still being with what I chose to shoot (I'm still trying to shake this habit).</p> -->
